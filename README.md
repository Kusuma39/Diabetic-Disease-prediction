# Diabetic-Disease-prediction
Introduction Diabetes is a medical disorder that has an impact on how well your body uses food as fuel. The majority of the food you consume is converted to sugar, commonly known as glucose, and then released into your circulation. Your pancreas releases insulin when your blood sugar levels rise.  Diabetes can cause blood sugar levels to rise if it is not continuously and carefully managed, which raises the chance of serious side effects including heart attack and stroke. I thus choose to forecast using Python machine learning.
